# dynaep.perception.modality_tracker - Cross-Modality State Atomicity
# OPT-010: Provides atomic read-evaluate-update for the cross-modality
# constraint. Uses threading.Lock to protect the sequence:
#   get_active_state -> rego_evaluate -> record_activation
#
# THREAD SAFETY: The Python version MUST use threading.Lock because Python
# threading can preempt between any two bytecode instructions.
